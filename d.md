<h1>Learning HTML</h1>
<hr>

<p>HTML is <b>easy.</b> It is just like normal writing except that you add markup symbals called <b><i>tags.</i></b><br> Each paragraph is written by putting in &lt;P&gt; tags. 

<br>
<br>

<p style="text-align:center" style ="font-size:200%">    It is easy to make text larger and centered.
